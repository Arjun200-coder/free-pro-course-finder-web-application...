                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Arjun Dhiman, and I am studying in Class 12. My school name is Public Inter College, Sadholi Kadeem. I live in Village Jatowala, Tehsil Behat, District Saharanpur. I study in Hindi medium. My subjects include Hindi, English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry.
                    There are 4 members in my family: my brother and my parents. My father works in labour. My mother is a homemaker.
                    When my class teacher introduced me to coding, I instantly got hooked. It was fascinating to see how computer applications work as a blend of software and hardware. This experience not only sparked my curiosity but also fueled my passion to dive deeper into the world of coding.
                    In May, our class teacher introduced me about CodeYogi, an initiative aimed at helping students from rural areas learn coding.
                    Through CodeYogi, I have learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and React. At home, I practice coding on both my mobile phone and PC. So far, I have completed 50 levels of the Telegram course and 3 lectures from the advanced playlist.
                    My Dream:
                    I aspire to become a Software Engineer and work in software and web development. who provides innovative solutions to real-world problems. I aspire to build my own company that tackles job-related challenges and reduces unemployment by connecting people with opportunities. I want to contribute to the IT sector by creating systems and applications that make life easier for everyone.
                    My Inspiration:
                    I believe hard work and a willingness to learn can help anyone achieve their goals. Coming from a humble background, I take pride in my journey so far and look forward to making a mark in the tech world. I aim to not only build my career but also inspire others who, like me, dare to dream big and work hard to achieve their aspirations.</p>
